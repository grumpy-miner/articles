# Python Time-Savers Code Examples

You'll find Jupyter Notebook file containing practical code examples for Python's built-in functions and modules that save my time. 
The examples comes from my article that you can find here: https://pawel-puchalski.com/5-python-built-in-functions-and-modules-that-save-time

## Overview

The code examples in this repository are designed to showcase the use of five specific Python built-in functions and modules:

1. **Shelve**: Demonstrates how to use shelve for simple persistent storage of Python objects, acting like a dictionary but stored on disk.
2. **Partial**: Shows the use of functools.partial to fix a certain number of function's arguments, making API calls more efficient.
3. **Batched**: Introduces itertools.batched, a new feature in Python 3.12, which simplifies the task of dividing iterables into batches of a specified size.
4. **Single Dispatch**: Utilizes functools.singledispatch to create generic functions that behave differently based on the type of their first argument.
5. **Closing**: Explains how to use contextlib.closing to ensure that resources are properly released after their use is complete.
